            <p class="one">I am a 19 year old born and raised in Washington D.C. getting into the software development field. I have past military experience, served for a little under 2 years before I was discharged. I've always been big on computers and am in the process of learning about becoming a software developer. Don't have much to write about right now but will come back to this when I have completed my course to make it a better portfolio. Really looking forward to learning all I can so that I can demonstrate my knowledge of the material through projects and creating webpages. By the end of the course i'll be able to show what I know in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Node.Js, Express.Js, SQL, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), Model-View-Controller(MVC), NoSQL, React, and MERN. </p>
            <p class="two">Don't know what else to tell you about myself so i'm just going to Lorem this for the purpose of the challenge. Quibusdam nostrum quasi reprehenderit vitae?
